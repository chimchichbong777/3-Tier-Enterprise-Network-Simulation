# 3-Tier Enterprise Network Simulation

## Project Overview
This project simulates a **3-tier enterprise network** using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
It demonstrates the design and implementation of a scalable and secure enterprise network, including **Access, Distribution, and Core layers**, VLAN segmentation, inter-VLAN routing, DMZ deployment, and firewall security.

---

## Network Topology
- **Core Layer:**
  - Layer 3 switches responsible for routing between Distribution layers and external networks.
  - Provides **high-speed backbone** connectivity and redundancy.

- **Distribution Layer:**
  - Aggregates VLANs from Access Layer.
  - Implements **inter-VLAN routing** and redundancy protocols (HSRP).

- **Access Layer:**
  - Connects end devices such as PCs, servers, and IoT devices.
  - Segments traffic into **VLANs** for different departments or services.

- **ASA Firewall:**
  - Provides NAT and ACL security between internal networks, DMZ, and outside networks.

- **DMZ Webserver:**
  - Hosts web services accessible to Inside networks and simulated external networks.
  - Isolated from internal LAN for security.

---

## Key Configurations
### VLANs & Routing
- Created multiple VLANs for internal segmentation (e.g., VLAN10, VLAN20, VLAN30, VLAN40).
- Inter-VLAN routing configured on Distribution/Core switches.
- HSRP implemented for **redundancy and high availability**.

### Access Control & Security
- ASA Firewall controls traffic:
  - **Inside → Outside:** NAT for Internet access.
  - **Outside → DMZ:** ACLs allow HTTP/HTTPS only.
- VLAN segmentation ensures isolation between departments and services.

### DMZ Deployment
- Webserver IP: `192.168.50.10`
- Accessible from Inside VLANs for testing HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
- DMZ isolated from other internal networks to prevent unauthorized access.

---

## Testing & Results
- **Inside VLAN → Inside VLAN:** Allowed according to routing and ACLs.
- **Inside VLAN → DMZ:** Ping and HTTP/HTTPS tests successful.
- **Inside VLAN → Internet:** NAT allows external connectivity (simulated in Packet Tracer).
- **Outside → DMZ:** ACL restricts access to HTTP/HTTPS only; all other traffic blocked.
